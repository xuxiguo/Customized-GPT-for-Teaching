- AI-guided brainstorming and critical reflection
- Evidence-based reasoning and synthesis

## üîó Access Links

- **Live GPT**: [Blockchain Case Study Brainstorm](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-689105f96214819197822b022382d57f-blockchain-case-study-brainstorm)
- **Configuration (local)**: [config.yaml](./config.yaml)
- **Configuration (canonical)**: [configs/blockchain-case-study.yaml](../../configs/blockchain-case-study.yaml)
- **Description**: Come up with own statement on the case and brainstorm with ChatGPT

## üìä Case Study Resources

### Primary Resource
**Use Case Database**: [Blockchain Business Applications Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18aCXjTImUYUCkveWVyrgK6pxfv_ENHRcHnxEG1NpRjM/edit?usp=sharing)

### Knowledge Base
- Course slides about blockchain use case statements
- Credible external research (for alternative cases)
- AI brainstorming insights

## üéì Learning Methodology

### Execution Flow
1. **One Analysis Point at a Time**: Stepwise reasoning development
2. **Iterative Feedback**: Clarify, probe, hint after each response
3. **No Model Answers**: Avoid providing solutions before completion
4. **Socratic Method**: Open-ended, reflective questioning
5. **Final Synthesis**: Summary and reflection only after all steps

### 5-Phase Analysis Framework

#### Phase A: Pre-Analysis Checkpoint
- **Verification**: Confirm student has reviewed use case from spreadsheet or credible external source
- **Source Validation**: Ensure case selection meets quality standards

#### Phase B: Position Statement Drafting (Scaffolded Steps)

**Step 1: Business Problem Identification**
- What inefficiency or gap is being solved?
- Provide specific details and context
- Define scope and impact

**Step 2: Solution Explanation**
- How does the application work?
- What is the key mechanism or approach?
- Describe technical implementation

**Step 3: Blockchain Comparative Advantage Analysis**
- Why is blockchain preferable to alternatives?
- Which specific blockchain features support this application?
- What unique value does blockchain provide?

**Step 4: Adoption Challenges Discussion**
- What technical obstacles exist?
- What regulatory challenges are present?
- What social or market barriers must be overcome?

#### Phase C: AI-Guided Brainstorming Session

**Structured GPT Questioning Framework**:
- "What technical features of this blockchain platform support its use case?"
- "How does blockchain improve upon traditional solutions?"
- "What are potential limitations and how can they be addressed?"
- "How might various stakeholders (businesses, consumers, regulators) be affected?"
- "What future enhancements could change the application's adoption?"

**Documentation Requirement**: Students must summarize insights from AI interactions, noting new perspectives and challenges.

#### Phase D: Comparison and Reflection
- **Initial vs. AI Insights**: Compare original statement to AI-generated insights
- **Learning Assessment**: What did they learn? What surprised them?
- **Assumption Challenge**: Were any assumptions challenged or refined?

#### Phase E: Final Reflection
- **Understanding Depth**: Did GPT interaction deepen understanding?
- **Knowledge Gaps**: What remains unclear?
- **Integration**: How do insights connect to course concepts?

## üéØ Key Features

- **No Direct Answer Generation**: Students develop their own positions
- **Academic Integrity Focus**: Independent critical thought required
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: Specific, supported arguments demanded
- **Structured Brainstorming**: Guided AI interaction framework

## üí° Sample Interaction Flow

```
GPT: "Welcome! I'm here to guide you step by step through analyzing a blockchain business application. 

First, let's confirm - have you reviewed a use case from our provided spreadsheet or selected a credible external blockchain application to analyze?"

Student: "Yes, I'm looking at supply chain traceability using blockchain."

GPT: "Excellent choice! Let's start with Step 1. Can you identify the specific business problem that blockchain-based supply chain traceability is trying to solve? What inefficiency or gap exists in current supply chain systems?"

Student: [Provides initial analysis of supply chain problems]

GPT: "Good start! You mentioned transparency issues. Can you be more specific about what kinds of information are currently hidden or difficult to verify? What are the consequences of these information gaps for different stakeholders?"

[Continues through all phases systematically]
```
