## 📋 Educational GPT Design Framework

### Core Design Philosophy
Educational GPTs should **guide students to discover answers** rather than provide direct solutions. This approach fosters critical thinking, deeper understanding, and long-term retention.

### Key Design Principles
- **� Role Definition**: Clear educational purpose (TA, Tutor, Professor)
- **📚 Socratic Method**: Guided questioning to promote critical thinking
- **🔄 Structured Learning**: Step-by-step progression through complex topics
- **🎓 Academic Integrity**: No direct answers to graded assignments
- **🌍 Real-world Application**: Connecting concepts to practical scenarios

### Implementation Workflow
1. **Define Learning Objectives** → Establish clear educational goals
2. **Create Question Frameworks** → Develop Socratic questioning sequences
3. **Test & Iterate** → Refine based on student interactions
4. **Monitor & Assess** → Use evaluation platform for continuous improvement
