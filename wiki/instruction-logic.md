# Instruction Logic for Educational GPT Design

This document outlines the core principles and methodology for designing effective educational GPTs that promote critical thinking and deep learning.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Create Your Own Educational GPT

### Step 1: Use the Prompt Builder Tool
**üîó [Prompt Builder GPT for Instructors](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6890ed7c1f648191a761225ce5035875-prompt-builder-gpt-for-instructors)**

Before diving into the detailed framework, instructors can use our specialized Prompt Builder GPT to create customized educational prompts. This tool will guide you through:
- Defining your specific educational context
- Selecting appropriate teaching methodologies
- Generating tailored prompts for your subject area
- Implementing best practices automatically

### Step 2: Apply the Framework Logic
Once you have your initial prompt from the builder, use the detailed framework below to understand and refine your educational GPT design.

## üéØ Core Design Philosophy

Educational GPTs should **guide students to discover answers** rather than provide direct solutions. This approach fosters critical thinking, deeper understanding, and long-term retention.

## üìã Framework Components

### 1. Role Definition
- **Clear Purpose**: Define specific educational role (Teaching Assistant, Course Tutor, Finance Professor)
- **Learning Focus**: Emphasize guidance in critical thinking over answer provision
- **Scope Boundaries**: Establish what the GPT can and cannot do

### 2. Primary Objectives
- **Learning Goals**: State specific educational outcomes (financial analysis, blockchain mechanics, data-driven decisions)
- **Real-world Connection**: Encourage application of concepts to practical scenarios
- **Curiosity & Reasoning**: Support structured thinking and intellectual curiosity

### 3. Resource Hierarchy
```
Priority 1: Course Materials (syllabus, readings, slides)
Priority 2: Reputable External Sources (academic articles, whitepapers)
Priority 3: Trusted News Sources (WSJ, Reuters, Forbes)
```

### 4. Execution Flow (AI Operation Logic)

#### Stepwise Questioning
- Present **one question at a time**
- Structure engagement to scaffold reasoning
- Build complexity progressively

#### Iterative Feedback Loop
```
Student Response ‚Üí AI Feedback ‚Üí Clarification/Probing ‚Üí Next Question
```

#### Key Principles:
- **No Early Disclosure**: Avoid summarizing before completion
- **Socratic Method**: Favor guided questioning over statements
- **Comprehension Check**: Don't progress until understanding is demonstrated
- **Session Conclusion**: Comprehensive summary only after all steps complete

### 5. Detailed Instruction Framework

#### Problem Breakdown Structure (Example: Blockchain Application Analysis)
1. **Define Core Problem**: What issue does this solve?
2. **Summarize Solution**: How does the platform address it?
3. **Evaluate Blockchain Advantage**: Why blockchain over alternatives?
4. **Analyze Adoption Challenges**: What barriers exist?
5. **Reflect on Future Developments**: What's the potential evolution?

#### Guiding Questions Framework
- **Technical Features**: "What specific features support the use case?"
- **Comparative Advantage**: "How does this enhance trust/efficiency?"
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: "Who is affected and how?"
- **Evidence Requirement**: "What data supports this conclusion?"

### 6. Response Style Guidelines

#### Tone & Approach
- **Professional & Supportive**: Maintain encouraging atmosphere
- **Structured Frameworks**: Provide clear thinking models
- **Real-world Analogies**: Use relatable examples when helpful
- **Counterarguments**: Challenge assumptions constructively

#### Special Elements by Context
- **Reading-based**: Verify completion before discussion
- **Simulation-based**: Outline analytical steps clearly
- **Coding-focused**: Assist debugging without writing full solutions

### 7. Boundaries & Academic Integrity

#### Strict Prohibitions
- ‚ùå No direct answers for graded assignments
- ‚ùå No replacement for live classroom discussion
- ‚ùå No policy circumvention
- ‚ùå No premature summarization

#### Encouraged Practices
- ‚úÖ Guide through reasoning process
- ‚úÖ Provide feedback and hints
- ‚úÖ Encourage evidence-based thinking
- ‚úÖ Support skill development

## üîÑ Implementation Workflow

### Phase 0: GPT Creation (Recommended Starting Point)
1. **Use Prompt Builder**: Access [Prompt Builder GPT for Instructors](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6890ed7c1f648191a761225ce5035875-prompt-builder-gpt-for-instructors)
2. **Define Context**: Specify your subject area, student level, and learning objectives
3. **Generate Initial Prompt**: Let the tool create a customized educational prompt
4. **Review & Refine**: Use the framework below to understand and enhance your prompt

### Phase 1: Setup & Customization
1. Define role and learning objectives (guided by Prompt Builder output)
2. Establish resource hierarchy for your specific course
3. Create question frameworks tailored to your content
4. Implement subject-specific special elements

### Phase 2: Testing & Interaction
1. Initial engagement with context check
2. Stepwise questioning sequence
3. Iterative feedback and guidance
4. Comprehension verification

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Refinement
1. Complete analysis review
2. Learning pathway summary
3. Key insights reinforcement
4. Future application suggestions
5. **Return to Prompt Builder for iterations if needed**
