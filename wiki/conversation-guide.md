## üí° Best Practices for Engagement

### Effective Conversation Strategies
1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed responses rather than vague answers
2. **Ask Questions**: Engage with follow-up questions to deepen understanding
3. **Challenge Assumptions**: Don't accept the first answer - dig deeper
4. **Connect Concepts**: Link new learning to previous knowledge
5. **Seek Examples**: Ask for real-world applications and analogies

### What to Expect
- **No Direct Answers**: GPTs guide you to discover solutions
- **Sequential Questions**: One topic at a time, building complexity
- **Socratic Method**: Questions designed to promote critical thinking
- **Iterative Feedback**: Responses will probe deeper into your thinking

### What NOT to Expect
- ‚ùå Complete assignment solutions
- ‚ùå Direct answers to graded work
- ‚ùå Replacement for course materials or lectures
- ‚ùå Immediate progression without demonstrated understanding

## üìä Conversation Quality Indicators

### High-Quality Interactions
- ‚úÖ You're asking follow-up questions
- ‚úÖ Responses show deeper thinking over time
- ‚úÖ You can explain concepts in your own words
- ‚úÖ You're making connections to real-world applications
- ‚úÖ You're challenging assumptions and seeking evidence

### Areas for Improvement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Seeking direct answers instead of understanding
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Moving too quickly through concepts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not engaging with GPT questions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Failing to provide specific examples or evidence

## üéì Educational Assessment

### Self-Evaluation Questions
After each conversation, ask yourself:
- What new concepts did I learn?
- How did my understanding evolve during the conversation?
- What questions do I still have?
- How can I apply this knowledge to other situations?
- What would I do differently in a similar analysis?

### Instructor Evaluation Points
- Depth of engagement with GPT questions
- Quality of reasoning in responses
- Ability to connect concepts across topics
- Evidence of critical thinking development
- Application of course frameworks and concepts

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **GPT not responding as expected**: Check if you're using the correct conversation starter
- **Too generic responses**: Provide more specific details in your questions
- **Stuck in conversation**: Ask the GPT to clarify or move to the next topic
- **Need to restart**: Begin a new conversation with the same GPT

### Technical Support
- Ensure ChatGPT Plus subscription is active
